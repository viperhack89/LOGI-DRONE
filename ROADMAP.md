# LOGI-DRONE – Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a **realistic, phased evolution** of the LOGI-DRONE
concept, from architectural definition to potential prototyping and testing.

The roadmap is **conceptual and non-binding**, intended to support discussion,
technical evaluation, and collaboration with industrial, academic, and R&D
partners.

- Resilience and fault-injection concepts
- Secure update and lifecycle considerations

**Deliverables:**
- Security testing plan
- Risk assessment summary
- Mitigation strategies overview

---

## Phase 7 – Field Evaluation Planning (Conceptual)

**Objective:**  
Define a controlled path toward real-world evaluation.

**Activities:**
- Identification of controlled test environments
- Regulatory and compliance considerations
- Operational safety constraints
- Metrics for performance evaluation

**Deliverables:**
