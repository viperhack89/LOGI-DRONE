# LOGI-DRONE – Partnership & Collaboration

LOGI-DRONE is an engineering-driven, conceptual project exploring autonomous
swarm-based logistics systems.

The project is open to **structured collaborations** with industrial, academic,
and research partners interested in contributing expertise, technology, or
resources to selected phases of the roadmap.

This document outlines **who we are looking for, why, and how collaboration
can be structured**.

---

## Collaboration Objectives

Partnerships are sought to:
- validate technical assumptions
- refine system architecture and security models
- explore feasibility and prototyping paths
- assess dual-use and operational applicability

The goal is **mutual technical value**, not commercial promotion.

---

## Who We Are Looking For

### Industrial Partners
Companies with experience in:
- unmanned systems and robotics
- aerospace or defence technologies
- embedded systems and real-time software
- secure communications and networking
- autonomy, AI, or distributed systems

### Research & Academic Institutions
Groups working on:
- swarm intelligence and multi-agent systems
- resilient and secure communication networks
- cyber-physical system security
- simulation, modeling, and digital twins

### Technology Providers
Vendors or integrators offering:
- sensors and navigation technologies
- communication modules and protocols
- cybersecurity solutions
- simulation and testing platforms

---

## Areas of Collaboration

Potential collaboration areas include:
- system and swarm architecture design
- communication and security modeling
- simulation and feasibility analysis
- threat modeling and resilience evaluation
- non-operational prototyping concepts

The scope of collaboration can be **clearly bounded** to specific roadmap phases.

## Intellectual Property

All intellectual property related to the LOGI-DRONE concept remains the property
of the author.

Collaboration does not imply transfer of ownership.  
Specific IP arrangements can be defined separately where required.

---

## Collaboration Model

Possible collaboration models include:
- technical discussion and peer review
- joint feasibility studies
- research-oriented contributions
- proof-of-concept definition

Any collaboration is expected to be:
- professional
- transparent
- aligned with applicable legal and regulatory frameworks
